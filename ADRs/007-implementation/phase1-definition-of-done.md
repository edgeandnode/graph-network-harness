# Phase 1: Command Executor - Definition of Done

**Status: ✅ 100% COMPLETE**

Last Updated: 2025-01-21
Completed: 2025-01-21

## Objective
Create a standalone `command-executor` crate that provides type-safe, unified command execution using a composable nested launcher architecture that works across any execution context (Local, SSH, Docker, etc.) with proper event streaming integration.

## Deliverables

### 1. Crate Structure ✓ When:
- [x] `crates/command-executor/` exists with proper Cargo.toml
- [x] All required dependencies are specified (openssh included, bollard pending)
- [x] Feature flags for optional backends (ssh, docker) are defined
- [x] Crate builds without warnings

### 2. Core Types ✓ When:
- [x] `Executor<T>` struct is implemented with service_name tracking
- [x] Using async_process::Command directly (runtime-agnostic)
  - [x] Program and arguments
  - [x] Environment variables
  - [x] Working directory
  - [x] Builder pattern with method chaining
- [x] Signal methods on Process trait (terminate, kill, interrupt, reload)
- [x] Process trait returns event stream + exit status
- [x] Target types as individual structs per backend:
  - [x] Command (one-off execution)
  - [x] ManagedProcess (we manage lifecycle)
  - [x] SystemdService (systemctl commands)
  - [x] SystemdPortable (portablectl commands)
  - [x] DockerContainer (docker run)
  - [x] ComposeService (docker-compose commands)

### 3. Event Integration ✓ When:
- [x] Uses ProcessEvent (simpler than ServiceEvent, harness will convert)
- [x] Stdout/stderr are converted to ProcessEvent instances
- [x] Process lifecycle events (Started, Exited) are generated
- [x] Line buffering for stdout/stderr
- [x] LogFilter trait for optional filtering

### 4. Launcher/Attacher Traits ✓ When:
- [x] `Backend` trait renamed to `Launcher` trait
- [x] `Launcher` trait uses associated types for EventStream and Handle
- [x] No unnecessary dynamic dispatch
- [x] `execute()` and `launch()` methods are implemented
- [x] `Attacher` trait created for connecting to existing services
- [x] `AttachedHandle` trait for service lifecycle control
- [x] Proper error handling with custom error types

### 5. Local Launcher Implementation ✓ When:
- [x] `LocalLauncher` fully implements Launcher trait
- [x] Handles LaunchedTarget types:
- [x] Command: Direct process spawning with async-process
- [x] ManagedProcess: Process lifecycle management

### 7. Nested Launcher Architecture ✓ When:

- [x] LocalLauncher handles Docker targets:
  - [x] DockerContainer: `docker run` commands
  - [x] ComposeService: `docker-compose` commands
  - [x] Container lifecycle management
- [x] Static dispatch with zero runtime overhead
- [x] Type-safe composition of execution contexts

### 8. SSH Launcher Implementation ✓ When:

- [x] Transforms commands for SSH execution
- [x] Supports nested SSH (jump hosts)
- [x] Key-based authentication support
- [x] Handles all target types via delegation

### 9. Process Management ✓ When:
- [x] `ProcessHandle` trait with event streaming for launched processes
- [x] `AttachedHandle` trait for attached service control
- [x] Signal methods work appropriately for each handle type:
  - [x] Local launched: Unix signals via nix

   );
   let (events, handle) = remote.launch(&docker_target, command).await?;
   ```

   **Attaching to services:**
   ```rust
   // Service attachment and control
   let (events, handle) = attacher.attach(&service, config).await?;
   
   // Monitor service and control as needed
   while let Some(event) = events.next().await {
       if should_restart(&event) {
           handle.restart().await?;
       }
   }
   ```

  - `SystemdPortable::new()`
  - `ManagedService::builder()` with comprehensive builder pattern
- Added necessary getter methods for accessing private fields
- All tests updated to use the new Command API
