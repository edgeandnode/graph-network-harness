```

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Validation & Conversion
```rust
// crates/harness-config/src/validator.rs

```

#### Wednesday: Logging System
```rust
// crates/harness/src/commands/logs.rs
- [ ] Implement logs command with --follow
- [ ] Add --tail, --since, --grep options
- [ ] Set up log aggregation from multiple sources
- [ ] Handle different log formats
```

#### Thursday: Init & Health
```rust
// crates/harness/src/commands/init.rs
- [ ] Implement init with templates
- [ ] Add interactive mode
- [ ] Implement health command
- [ ] Detailed health check output
```

#### Friday: Integration & Polish
- [ ] End-to-end tests for all commands
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add progress indicators
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Deliverables
- All basic commands working
- Integration tests passing
- User-friendly error messages
- <100ms command startup time

## Week 3: Advanced Features (Feb 10-14, 2025)

### Goals

- Network management commands
- Shell completion and polish

### Milestones

#### Monday: Deployment Commands
```rust
// crates/harness/src/commands/deploy.rs
- [ ] Implement deploy command
- [ ] Add package command for creating archives
- [ ] Version tracking
- [ ] Rollback support
```

#### Tuesday: Network Commands
```rust
// crates/harness/src/commands/network.rs
- [ ] Implement network list/show
- [ ] Add network discover
- [ ] Network connectivity testing
- [ ] Topology visualization
```

#### Wednesday: Exec & Config Advanced
```rust
// crates/harness/src/commands/exec.rs
- [ ] Implement exec command
- [ ] Interactive mode support
- [ ] Restart with rolling updates
- [ ] Advanced filtering options

// crates/harness/src/commands/config.rs (continued)
- [ ] Config check: structural validation
- [ ] Config check: port conflict detection
- [ ] Config check: dependency cycle detection
- [ ] Config check: file existence checks
```

#### Thursday: Shell Completion
- [ ] Generate bash completion
- [ ] Generate zsh completion  
- [ ] Generate fish completion
- [ ] Test completions
- [ ] Package for distribution

#### Friday: Documentation & Release
- [ ] User guide with examples
- [ ] Man page generation
- [ ] CI/CD setup
- [ ] Release packaging
- [ ] Performance profiling

### Deliverables
- Feature-complete CLI
- Shell completions for major shells
- Comprehensive documentation
- Ready for v0.1.0 release

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each command module has unit tests
- Parser edge cases covered
- Validation logic tested

### Integration Tests
```bash
# tests/cli_integration.rs
- Test full command flows
- Multi-service scenarios  
- Error recovery
- Network failure cases
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
# Start real services
cargo test --features e2e-tests

# Test scenarios:
- Graph node deployment
- Microservices with dependencies
- Cross-network communication
- Package deployment
```

## Success Metrics

### Week 1
- [ ] YAML parser handles all service types
- [ ] Validation catches common errors
- [ ] Basic CLI structure in place

### Week 2  
- [ ] All core commands implemented
- [ ] Commands respond in <100ms
- [ ] Integration tests passing

### Week 3
- [ ] Advanced features complete
- [ ] Documentation comprehensive
- [ ] Ready for user testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Complex dependency resolution**
   - Mitigation: Use petgraph for DAG operations
   - Fallback: Simple topological sort

2. **Cross-platform compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Test on Linux/macOS/Windows
   - Fallback: Linux-first, others best-effort

3. **Performance with many services**
   - Mitigation: Concurrent operations
   - Fallback: Add --parallel flag limits

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict feature freeze after week 1
   - Fallback: Move nice-to-haves to Phase 6

2. **Integration complexity**
   - Mitigation: Incremental integration
   - Fallback: Simplify advanced features

## Definition of Done

Phase 5 is complete when:

- [ ] All commands implemented and tested
- [ ] YAML configuration fully supported
- [ ] Shell completions available
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Performance targets met (<100ms startup)
- [ ] Error messages helpful and actionable
- [ ] Integration tests cover all scenarios
