# CLI Enhancement Plan

This document tracks the enhancement of CLI commands for the graph-network-harness Phase 6 completion.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Commands
- [x] **start**: Enhanced with dependency ordering, progress indicators, and health checks
- [x] **stop**: Enhanced with proper dependency handling and force/timeout flags
- [ ] **status**: Basic table with minimal info
- [ ] **validate**: Basic YAML validation and env var checking
- [ ] **daemon status**: Check daemon connectivity

### Critical Issues
- [x] Daemon handlers use `smol::block_on` inside mutex lock (potential deadlock) - FIXED
- [x] No proper dependency resolution for stop command - FIXED
- [x] Limited error context and user feedback - IMPROVED
- [x] Missing environment variable and service reference resolution - COMPLETED
- [ ] Update all unit tests that do async and have them run with smol_potat instead

### Lower Priority code Issues
- [ ] fix: 'service-registry/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for async-tungstenite, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.async-tungstenite`, this could become a hard error in the future'

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Fix Daemon Handler Concurrency ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Replace std::sync::Mutex with futures::lock::Mutex in DaemonState - Actually removed mutex entirely
- [x] Update ServiceManager to use async-safe locking - ServiceManager already handles its own locking

- [ ] Add last health check timestamp (needs health check metadata)
- [x] Implement `--json` flag for machine-readable output
- [x] Implement `--watch` flag for continuous updates

- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (15+ tests passing)

### 8. User Experience Improvements üí´
- [x] Add progress indicators (‚úì/‚úó) for commands
- [x] Implement consistent error formatting
- [x] Add contextual help messages
- [ ] Support `--verbose` and `--quiet` flags globally
- [ ] Add shell completion generation
- [ ] Improve startup time to <100ms
- [ ] Add `--no-color` flag for CI environments

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [x] Dependency resolution algorithms (completed in dependencies.rs)
- [x] Environment variable substitution (nom-based parser)
- [x] Service reference resolution (${service.ip/port/host})
- [x] Configuration validation logic (strict validation rules)

### Integration Tests

  - Environment variables must start with an uppercase letter
  - No support for `ENV.KEY` format (only `${VAR}` syntax)
  - Service properties limited to `ip`, `port`, and `host`
- **Comprehensive template support**:
  - `${VAR}` - Environment variable substitution
  - `${VAR:-default}` - Environment variable with default value
  - `${service.ip}` - Service IP address resolution
  - `${service.port}` - Service port resolution
  - `${service.host}` - Service hostname resolution
- **Robust error handling** with detailed validation messages
- **Full test coverage** - 15 tests passing including edge cases
- **CLI integration** - validate command now checks all variable references
- **Backward compatibility** maintained with existing YAML files

  - Process IDs and container IDs (truncated to 12 chars)
  - Service dependencies from configuration
  - Service endpoints and their mappings
