# Current Implementation Status

Last Updated: 2025-08-03

## Overall Progress

The Graph Network Harness has a solid foundation with core orchestration functionality implemented. The system can manage services across different execution environments with a clean, layered architecture.

## Architecture Decisions Implemented

### âœ… Runtime Agnostic Design
- All crates use async-trait
- No direct tokio/async-std dependencies in library crates
- Tests use smol runtime
- Binary uses smol for consistency

### âœ… Layered Execution
- Clear separation between command building and execution
- Composable layers for SSH, Docker, etc.
- Stdin forwarding through all layers

### âœ… Service/Action Model
- Services have strongly typed actions and events
- JSON Schema for API documentation
- Event streaming for real-time feedback

### âœ… Daemon Architecture
- Long-running daemon process
- Client/server separation
- TLS-secured WebSocket communication
- Persistent service state

## Known Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Some tests have outdated imports after the module restructuring
2. **Generic Type Cleanup**: Some remnants of old generic types in tests
3. **Executor Registration**: Hardcoded executor types in ServiceManager
4. **Error Handling**: Some error types could be more specific
5. **Documentation**: Several modules missing comprehensive docs

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete graph-test-daemon action implementations
2. Fix remaining test compilation errors
3. Implement SshExecutor in service-orchestration
4. Add integration tests for full stack

### Medium Term
1. Implement systemd support
2. Add service log streaming
3. Create example configurations
4. Improve error messages and debugging

### Long Term
1. Web UI for service management
2. Kubernetes backend
3. Metrics and tracing
4. Multi-node orchestration

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- âœ… command-executor: Comprehensive tests for all components
- âœ… service-registry: Good coverage for core functionality
- âœ… service-orchestration: Basic executor tests
- â¬œ harness-core: Needs more test coverage
- â¬œ graph-test-daemon: Tests defined but not implemented

### Integration Tests
- âœ… Docker-based tests with test containers
- âœ… SSH tests with Docker containers
- â¬œ Full stack integration tests
- â¬œ Graph Protocol scenario tests

### Test Infrastructure
- âœ… CI pipeline with cargo xtask
- âœ… Docker-in-Docker for isolation
- âœ… Conditional test execution (docker-tests, ssh-tests features)
- âœ… Session-based logging for debugging
