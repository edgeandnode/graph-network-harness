# Documentation Status

## Recently Updated (Current)

These documents were updated to reflect the current architecture:

1. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** ✅
   - Complete system overview with accurate component relationships
   - Correct layered architecture diagrams
   - Current crate descriptions

2. **docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md** ✅
   - Accurate implementation percentages
   - Correct list of implemented vs missing features
   - Known issues and next steps

3. **docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md** ✅
   - Current code examples
   - Accurate import paths (except one minor note about old imports)
   - Correct architectural patterns

4. **docs/service-orchestration-architecture.md** ✅ **[UPDATED TODAY]**
   - Updated to show proper relationship with command-executor
   - Added ServiceSetup and DeploymentTask documentation
   - Added runtime validation and service target variants
   - Updated with managed vs attached service modes

5. **crates/command-executor/README.md** ✅
   - Completely rewritten to reflect layered architecture
   - Correct examples using LayeredExecutor
   - Proper launcher/attacher separation

6. **docs/service-setup-and-tasks.md** ✅ **[NEW TODAY]**
   - Comprehensive guide to ServiceSetup trait
   - DeploymentTask documentation with examples
   - YAML configuration for tasks and dependencies
   - Implementation guide and best practices

## Documents That Are Still Current

These documents remain accurate:

1. **crates/service-orchestration/README.md** ✅
   - Abstract enough to remain valid
   - API examples still correct

2. **crates/command-executor/STDIN_ARCHITECTURE.md** ✅
   - Accurately describes current stdin implementation
   - Diagrams match code

3. **crates/service-orchestration/COMPOSABLE_ARCHITECTURE.md** ✅
   - Conceptual document, implementation-agnostic

4. **ADRs/** ✅
   - Architecture Decision Records describe decisions, not implementations
   - Still valid as historical records

5. **Test READMEs** ✅
   - Test container documentation is accurate
   - Test setup instructions work

## Documents Needing Creation

1. **crates/harness-core/README.md** ❌
   - No README exists for this important crate
   - Should document BaseDaemon, ServiceStack, TaskStack

2. **crates/harness/README.md** ❌
   - Missing user-facing documentation for the CLI

3. **crates/service-registry/README.md** ❌
   - Would benefit from usage examples

4. **crates/harness-config/README.md** ❌
   - YAML format documentation needed

5. **crates/graph-test-daemon/README.md** ❌
   - Needs documentation once implementation is complete

## Minor Issues Found

1. **docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md**
   - Line 242 mentions old import pattern as an example of what NOT to do (this is fine)

2. **docs/ISSUES-BACKLOG.md**
   - Still references some old issues but doesn't contain outdated architecture info
   - Should be updated to remove completed items

## Summary

The documentation has been successfully updated to reflect the current architecture including the new service setup and deployment task system. The main updates were:
- Removing references to nested/generic launchers
- Updating to show layered execution model
- Correcting import paths (backends::local:: → backends::)
- Showing launcher/attacher separation
- Updating executor implementation details
- **NEW**: Adding ServiceSetup trait documentation
- **NEW**: Adding DeploymentTask system documentation
- **NEW**: Documenting runtime validation
- **NEW**: Explaining managed vs attached service modes

All critical documentation now accurately represents the current codebase structure including the latest service lifecycle management features.
